            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                As an immigration, of course English is not my main language, I have to try and learn as hard as I can to
                get used to new environment in a new country.
                After years trying and learning during school years, I had completed my four years of Bachelor’s Degree
                in Electrical Engineer, and became an American with U.S Citizenship.

                After School years, I have been looking for Engineer jobs. It was hard to get and Engineering job at
                that time. I found a job as a Technician in an Aerospace company. I learned and improve my skills while
                working there. With all the time worked hard and improved my skills, I finally found career with
                Manufacturing Engineer at Out of the Box company. New career, new skills, I need to keep learning and
                improve myself. After few years working at Out of the Box, I decided to learn another skills outside of
                Out of the Box. And Web Development coming to my life.

                Web Development is an interesting and fun field to learn and explore. Also, when I was in school, I had
                took some coding/programming class, but I still could not get better at it. When I saw Web Development
                course opened, I decided to take a part-time course at UW Boot Camp to give myself a second chance to
                learn and improve my coding skills. Web Development will be my new field that I want to become expert at
                it. Since coding is not my strongest skill, I want to walking through my failure to become better
                person. Like Winston Churchill said “Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm”
